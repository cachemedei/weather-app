# Weather App
An app using the Current Weather Data API from OpenWeatherMap to show a user the current temperature, conditions, a high and low for the day and a 3 day forecast for any location that a user searches

# Notes & Plans
- The date does not currently reflect what location has been searched
- Plans to implement weather icons to complement weather conditions
- Adding a autofill feature for the search bar
- Create a smoother render when the data loads

# OpenWeatherMap

- Daily Forecast 16 Days: https://openweathermap.org/forecast16


# React + Vite
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
